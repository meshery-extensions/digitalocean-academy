# DigitalOcean Academy — Curriculum Master Outline

> A comprehensive, AI‑first learning library for the **DigitalOcean Academy**, built on the
> [Layer5 Academy](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/academy/) platform. The curriculum focuses
> heavily on DigitalOcean's **Gradient™ AI Platform** and the broader **AI‑Native Cloud**, and
> threads **[Meshery](https://meshery.io/)** — the open‑source cloud native manager — through the
> infrastructure, operations, and observability content so that learners can design, deploy,
> performance‑test, and govern AI workloads on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) and GPU Droplets.

This document is the **skeletal outline** of the entire academy. It defines the learning paths,
their courses and chapters, the hands‑on challenges, and the **DigitalOcean Certified AI Engineer
(DO‑CAIE)** certification. The generated Hugo content under `content/` implements this outline.

## Certification — DigitalOcean Certified AI Engineer (DO‑CAIE)

**Format:** Multiple‑choice (single‑ and multiple‑answer) questions and a hands‑on capstone ·
**Pass mark:** 70% on the written exam **and** a passing capstone submission ·
**Recommended prep:** Learning Paths 1–5.

### The certification entity

The certification is a first‑class `type: "certification"` content entity at
`content/certifications/3e2f9c82-1a4c-4781-adf9-99ec22cd994e/digitalocean-certified-ai-engineer/`.
It carries the competency blueprint (domains + weighting), `prerequisite_knowledge` (the learning
paths), `related_resources` (challenges and docs), and `additional_attributes` (exam format, pass
mark, capstone, retake policy, validity). It is **distinct from, and supported by**, the
**DO‑CAIE Certification Prep** learning path and the **DO‑CAIE Certification Exam** challenge.

### Exam blueprint (domains & weighting)

| Domain | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 1. AI‑Native Cloud fundamentals & service selection | 12% |
| 2. Foundation models, serverless inference & the model catalog | 14% |
| 3. Building agents with the Gradient AI Platform | 18% |
| 4. Knowledge Bases & RAG | 14% |
| 5. GPU compute, 1‑Click Models & model serving | 14% |
| 6. Cloud native AI operations with Meshery & DOKS | 16% |
| 7. Production engineering: routing, security, observability & responsible AI | 12% |

### Certification prep learning path (content)

1. **Certification Overview** — who it's for, format, scheduling, scoring, recertification
2. **Exam Domains Study Guide** — domain‑by‑domain objectives mapped to learning paths and lessons
3. **Capstone Project Guide** — requirements, rubric, and submission process for the hands‑on capstone

### Capstone (delivered as a challenge)

Build and operate an end‑to‑end agentic application: a RAG agent on the Gradient AI Platform backed
by a knowledge base, served alongside a self‑hosted model on DOKS GPU nodes, deployed and
performance‑tested with Meshery, with guardrails and evaluations in place. Graded by rubric + a
written certification exam.

---

## Hands‑on Challenges

Each challenge ships a guided **lab** and a graded **exam** (`pass_percentage: 70`).

1. **Deploy an LLM on GPU Droplets** — stand up a 1‑Click / vLLM model and call its OpenAI‑compatible endpoint.
2. **Build a RAG Agent with Knowledge Bases** — ground a Gradient agent on your own data and verify citations.
3. **Manage a DOKS GPU Cluster with Meshery** — import a cluster, deploy an inference Design, and run a Performance Profile.
4. **DO‑CAIE Certification Exam** — the comprehensive certification capstone exam.

## Importable Meshery designs

The Meshery learning path and the *Manage a DOKS GPU Cluster with Meshery* challenge are backed by
real, importable designs in the [`designs/`](./designs/) directory. Each is valid Kubernetes YAML, so
it can be imported into Meshery (`mesheryctl design import -f <file> -s "Kubernetes Manifest"`),
opened and validated in **Kanvas**, deployed to a DOKS GPU cluster, and saved to the Meshery Catalog
as a reusable template — or applied directly with `kubectl`.

| Design | Installs |
|--------|----------|
| `designs/vllm-inference-stack.yaml` | A vLLM OpenAI-compatible LLM server on a DOKS GPU node pool |
| `designs/qdrant-vector-db.yaml` | A Qdrant vector database backed by DigitalOcean Block Storage |
| `designs/gpu-observability-stack.yaml` | The NVIDIA DCGM exporter for GPU metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) |

See [`designs/README.md`](./designs/README.md) for prerequisites and step-by-step import and
performance-testing instructions.
