The **DigitalOcean Certified AI Engineer (DO-CAIE)** is the DigitalOcean Academy's flagship
credential. It validates that you can take an AI application from idea to production on DigitalOcean's
AI-Native Cloud — building grounded, agentic applications on the
[Gradient AI Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/gradient-ai-platform/), serving models
on GPU infrastructure, and operating it all with [Meshery](https://meshery.io/) on
[DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/).

## How you earn it

The credential has two required parts:

1. A **written exam** - 60 multiple-choice (single- and multiple-answer) questions across the seven
   domains above (90 minutes, proctored), drawn from a larger pool. Pass mark **70%**.
2. A **hands-on capstone** — an end-to-end agentic application served on GPU infrastructure and
   operated with Meshery, graded against a published rubric.

Both the exam and the capstone are delivered as the
[DO-CAIE Certification Exam challenge](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/challenges/3e2f9c82-1a4c-4781-adf9-99ec22cd994e/docaie-certification-exam/).

## How to prepare

Work through the five core learning paths, then the
[DO-CAIE Certification Prep](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/3e2f9c82-1a4c-4781-adf9-99ec22cd994e/certified-ai-engineer/)
path for the exam blueprint, a domain-by-domain study guide, practice questions, and the capstone
guide. The competency blueprint above shows where to focus your study time.

## What it proves

A certified DO-CAIE holder can select the right DigitalOcean AI service for a workload, call models
through serverless inference and the Inference Engine, build agents with knowledge bases and tools,
serve open models on GPU Droplets and DOKS, and operate the infrastructure with Meshery — designing,
deploying, performance-testing, and observing AI workloads cloud-natively.
