# Meshery Academy for DigitalOcean

This repo is the content repository for the Meshery Academy for DigitalOcean, which can be run stand-alone and alongside your Meshery deployment(s) for an integrated learning experience. This academy contains learning paths, challenges, and certifications, helping engineers learn how to manage AI services and infrastructure with Meshery on DigitalOcean.

🔗 **Live site:** <https://digitalocean.layer5.io/academy>

**[Academies as Meshery Extensions](https://docs.meshery.io/extensions/academies/)**

Academies are modular, Git-native learning management systems (LMS), which can be run stand-alone and/or as an extension of your Meshery deployment(s) for an integrated learning experience. Academies emphasize hands-on, cloud-native education (AI, Cloud, Kubernetes, CNCF projects, configuration and infrastructure management) through structured curricula, interactive Labs, embedded visualizations, and verifiable credentials.

## ✍️ Content Authoring

### Content Hierarchy

The Academy content follows this structure: **Learning Path → Course → Chapter → Lesson**.

```text
content/
└── learning-paths/
    ├── _index.md
    └── 3e2f9c82-1a4c-4781-adf9-99ec22cd994e/   # DigitalOcean org UID
        └── <your-learning-path>/
            ├── _index.md
            └── <your-course>/
                ├── _index.md
                └── content/
                    ├── lesson-1.md
                    └── lesson-2.md
```

### Adding Images

Use the `usestatic` shortcode (not standard Markdown image links) for tenant-aware asset paths:

1. Place your image in `static/3e2f9c82-1a4c-4781-adf9-99ec22cd994e/images/`
2. Reference it in your lesson:
   ```text
   ![Alt text]({{< usestatic path="images/your-image.png" >}})
   ```

### Adding Videos

```text
{{< card title="Video: Example" >}}
<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
    <source src="https://example.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
{{< /card >}}
```

### Adding Assessments

Assessment files use the Academy test layout. Question and option IDs must be unique within their scope.

```yaml
---
title: "Assessment Example"
id: "assessment-example"
type: "test"
layout: "test"
passPercentage: 70
maxAttempts: 3
timeLimit: 30
numberOfQuestions: 1
questions:
  - id: "q1"
    text: "DigitalOcean Academy content is authored in Markdown."
    type: "true-false"
    marks: 1
    options:
      - id: "true"
        text: "True"
        isCorrect: true
      - id: "false"
        text: "False"

```
